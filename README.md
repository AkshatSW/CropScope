# CropScope
Plant diseases can lead to massive crop losses, and detecting them early on is crucial for farmers. However, identifying plant diseases can be a challenging task, even for experienced farmers. As a result, we want to create a software solution that can help farmers identify plant diseases quickly and accurately, which will ultimately lead to better crop yields and a more sustainable food system.

## Problem Statement

Plant diseases are a big problem for farmers. They cause crops to die, which means less food for everyone. We want to make it easier for farmers to find out if their plants are sick, so they can do something about it and save their crops.

## Solution Proposed

CropScope is a software solution that uses computer vision to detect plant diseases. By analyzing images of plants, our software can quickly and accurately identify diseases and provide recommendations for treatment. The recommendations include the type of fertilizer that can be used along with the disease that the average number of plants are suffering from. CropScope is designed to be user-friendly, and it can be used by farmers with minimal technical expertise.

## Goal

Our goal is to create a software that can be helpful in detecting plant health and provide a possible outcome of fertilizer that can be used along with the disease that the average number of plants are suffering with. By doing this, we hope to make the planet a healthier and more sustainable place.

## Utilities Used

CropScope is developed using a range of cutting-edge technologies. The following utilities were used:

- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **TensorFlow** for developing machine learning models.
- **ReactJS** for developing the user interface.
- **Postman** for testing the API endpoints.
- **Docker** for containerizing the application.
- **FastAPI** for developing the RESTful API.

## How to Run

To run CropScope on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the CropScope repository from GitHub.
2. Open PyCharm IDE.
3. Open the `main.py` file.
4. Debug the file.
5. Go to `localhost:8080/docs` in your browser.
6. Click "Try it out."
7. Upload an image of the plant.
8. Click "Execute."
9. The output will be displayed on the screen.

## Conclusion

CropScope is a powerful tool that can help farmers detect plant diseases quickly and accurately. By providing farmers with recommendations for treatment, we hope to help them save their crops and contribute to a more sustainable food system.
